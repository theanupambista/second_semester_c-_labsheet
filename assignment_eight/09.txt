Function overloading and function overriding are two important concepts in C++.

Function Overloading:

Function overloading refers to the creation of multiple functions with the same name in a single class.
These functions must have different parameters (number, type, or order) to distinguish them.
The compiler selects the appropriate function to call based on the arguments passed at the time of calling.
Function overloading occurs at compile time.
Example:
class Shape {
public:
    void area(int length, int breadth) {
        cout << "Area of Rectangle: " << length * breadth << endl;
    }
    void area(int radius) {
        cout << "Area of Circle: " << 3.14 * radius * radius << endl;
    }
};
Function Overriding:

Function overriding refers to the creation of a function with the same name and signature in both the base class and the derived class.
The function in the derived class overrides the function in the base class, so the function in the derived class is called instead of the function in the base class.
Function overriding occurs at runtime.
Example:

class Shape {
public:
    virtual void area() {
        cout << "Area of Shape" << endl;
    }
};

class Rectangle : public Shape {
public:
    void area() {
        cout << "Area of Rectangle" << endl;
    }
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void area() {
        cout << "Area of Circle" << endl;
    }
};
To summarize, the key difference between function overloading and function overriding is that function overloading refers to the creation of multiple functions with the same name in a single class, while function overriding refers to the creation of a function with the same name and signature in both the base class and the derived class, where the function in the derived class overrides the function in the base class.
