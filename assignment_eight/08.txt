In C++, operator functions are special functions that are used to define the behavior of operators when applied to objects of a class. They are member functions of a class that have the same name as an operator and are invoked when the operator is used on objects of the class.

The syntax for an operator function is as follows:

return-type operator operator-symbol (parameters) {
    // function body
}
Here, return-type is the data type returned by the operator function, operator-symbol is the symbol of the operator to be overloaded, and parameters are the arguments passed to the operator function.

For example, suppose we have a Point class that represents a point in a two-dimensional space, with x and y as its coordinates. We can overload the + operator to allow two Point objects to be added together as follows:

class Point {
private:
    int x, y;
public:
    Point(int x = 0, int y = 0) {
        this->x = x;
        this->y = y;
    }
    Point operator+(const Point& p) {
        Point sum;
        sum.x = this->x + p.x;
        sum.y = this->y + p.y;
        return sum;
    }
};

int main() {
    Point p1(1, 2);
    Point p2(3, 4);
    Point p3 = p1 + p2;
    std::cout << "The sum of the points is (" << p3.x << ", " << p3.y << ")" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
In this example, we have defined an operator+ function for the Point class. The function takes a const reference to another Point object as a parameter, and returns a new Point object that represents the sum of the two points.

In the main() function, we create two Point objects p1 and p2, and add them together using the + operator. The result is stored in a third Point object p3, which is then displayed to the user.

This is just one example of how operator functions can be used to provide custom behavior for operators in C++. By overloading operators, we can make our classes more intuitive and easy to use, and provide powerful new functionality for our programs.
